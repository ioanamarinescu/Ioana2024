The main documentation is in README. This file is a summary of main things to know for me.

If you ever want to see the original code the website was based on, check out https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv (this link is also present at the top of the page).

To experiment with changes to the website on GitHub without pushing changes live to Netlify, you can stop build in Netlify: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silver-duckanoo-ef1c85/configuration/deploys#build-settings. When you
're ready to deploy, you can unstop the build in Netlify.

To automatically update papers, simply upload an updated version of publications.bib in the main folder called Ioana2024. For me, I take this from Zotero Marinescu/PapersAllNoDup. Then go to pull requests, and approve the merger of the changes (you can preview changes based on the output of the bot in there).

To make a paper featured, go to content folder, to the folder of the paper, and add featured: true (or modify featured: false).

To upload CV, update resume.pdf in folder "content/static/uploads". Make sure the upload is correctly named resume.pdf, or it will not show up correctly in the website. To rename or delete a file, you have to first open it.

To update bio, go to content/authors/admin/_index.md.
