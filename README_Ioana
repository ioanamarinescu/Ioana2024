The main documentation is in README. This file is a summary of main things to know for me.

If you ever want to see the original code the website was based on, check out https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv (this link is also present at the top of the page).

To experiment with changes to the website on GitHub without pushing changes live to Netlify, you can stop build in Netlify: https://app.netlify.com/sites/silver-duckanoo-ef1c85/configuration/deploys#build-settings. When you
're ready to deploy, you can unstop the build in Netlify.

To automatically update papers, simply upload an updated version of publications.bib. For me, I take this from Zotero Marinescu/PapersAllNoDup.

To update bio, go to content/authors/admin/_index.md.
