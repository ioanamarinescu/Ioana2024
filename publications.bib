	abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for measuring the efficacy of medical interventions. However, RCTs are expensive, and use a limited population. Techniques to estimate the effects of stroke interventions from observational data that minimize confounding would be useful. We used regression discontinuity design (RDD), a technique well-established in economics, on the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) data set. RDD, based on regression, measures the occurrence of a discontinuity in an outcome (e.g., home discharge) as a function of an intervention (e.g., alteplase) that becomes significantly more likely when crossing the threshold of a continuous variable (e.g., time from symptom onset). The technique assumes that patients near either side of a threshold (e.g., 2.99 and 3.01 hours from symptom onset) are indistinguishable other than the use of the treatment. We compared outcomes of patients whose estimated onset to treatment time fell on either side of the treatment threshold for three cohorts of patients in the GWTG-Stroke data set that spanned different treatment thresholds for alteplase (3 hours, 2003-2007, N=1869; 3 hours, 2009-2016, N=13,086, and 4.5 hours, 2009-2016, N=6,550). Patient demographic characteristics were overall similar across the treatment thresholds. We did not find evidence of a discontinuity in discharge disposition at any treatment threshold attributable to alteplase. Potential reasons for failing to find an effect include violation of some RDD assumptions in clinical care and large sample sizes required.},

Using the 1992 survey of Employment Tribunal Applications in Great Britain and controlling for case selection, she finds that both the unemployment and the bankruptcy rates significantly decrease the probability of judges deciding in favor of dismissed employees. A one-point increase in the unemployment rate leads to a seven-point decrease in this probability; this effect, however, is not significant for unemployed workers. These findings are consistent with the idea that judges, while tailoring firing costs to economic circumstances, are somewhat more sensitive to firms' interests.},

As well as looking at a balance sheet measure of the debt/assets ratio, we also consider the probability of raising finance by issuing new equity, and the shares of bank debt and secured debt in total debt. We find a nonlinear relationship with the debt/assets ratio: firms that report positive but low R\&D use more debt finance than firms that report no R\&D, but the use of debt finance falls with R\&D intensity among those firms that report R\&D. We find a simpler relationship with the probability of issuing new equity: Firms that report R\&D are more likely to raise funds by issuing shares than firms that report no R\&D, and this probability increases with R\&D intensity. The shares of bank debt and secured debt in total debt are both lower for firms that report R\&D compared to those that do not, and tend to fall as R\&D intensity rises. We discuss possible explanations for these patterns.},

And how much do students weigh labor market outcomes when choosing a major? In this study we find that less than 15\% of a sample of community college students in California rank broad categories of majors accurately in terms of labor market outcomes. Students believe that salaries are 13\% higher than they actually are, on average, and students underestimate the probability of being employed by almost 25\%. We find that the main determinants of major choice are beliefs about course enjoyment and grades, but expected labor market outcomes also matter. Experimental estimates of the impact of expected labor market outcomes are larger than OLS estimates and show that a 10\% increase in salary is associated with a 14 to 18\% increase in the probability of choosing a specific category of majors.},

	abstract = {Social protection systems in developing countries are typically composed of a bundle of benefits, the major ones being health insurance and pensions. Benefit bundling may increase informality and decrease welfare. Indeed, if some of the benefits are valued at substantially less than their cost, workers may choose to forego all benefits, even though some other benefits are valued at or above their cost. We examine the impact of benefit bundling using a series of Colombian reforms. The key reform is the unification of the payment systems for health and pension, which made it more difficult to contribute differently to the one plan versus the other. Using the progressive roll-out of the unified payment system by firm size, we show that benefit bundling increases both full formality and full informality by about 1 percentage point. The increase in full formality is concentrated among salaried workers in small to medium firms, while the increase in full informality is concentrated among independent workers.},

	abstract = {This paper uses yearly panel data on OECD countries to analyze the relationship between growth and the cyclicality of the budget deficit. We develop new yearly estimates of the countercyclicality of the budget deficit and show that the budget deficit has become increasingly countercyclical in most OECD countries over the past twenty years. However, European Monetary Union (EMU) countries did not become more countercyclical. Using panel specifications with country- and year-fixed effects, we show that: (a) an increase in financial development, a decrease in openness to trade, and the adoption of an inflation-targeting regime move countries toward a more countercyclical budget deficit; (b) a more countercyclical budget deficit has a positive and significant effect on economic growth, and this effect is larger when financial development is lower.},

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) increased US unemployment benefits by \$600 a week. Theory predicts that FPUC should decrease job applications, while the effect on vacancy creation is ambiguous. We estimate the effect of FPUC on job applications and vacancy creation week by week, from March to July 2020, using granular data from the online jobs platform Glassdoor. We exploit variation in the proportional increase in benefits across local labor markets. To isolate the effect of FPUC, we flexibly allow for different trends in local labor markets differentially exposed to the COVID-19 crisis. We verify that trends in outcomes prior to the FPUC do not correlate with future increases in benefits, which supports our identification assumption. First, we find that a 10\% increase in unemployment benefits caused a 3.6\% decline in applications, but did not decrease vacancy creation; hence, FPUC increased labor market tightness (vacancies/applications). Second, we document that tightness was unusually depressed during the FPUC period. Altogether, our results imply that the positive effect of FPUC on tightness was likely welfare improving: FPUC decreased competition among applicants at a time when jobs were unusually scarce. Our results also help explain prior findings that FPUC did not decrease employment.},

	abstract = {Objective To conduct a systematic review of studies reporting prevalence rates of depression in women living in low-income circumstances in developed countries. Methods The published and unpublished literature was searched for studies reporting prevalence of depression in women with low income in developed countries. Searches, data extraction, and methodological appraisal were conducted twice independently. To perform the analysis, the meta and metafor packages in R, a random effect model to account for both between and within studies’ variances, and the restricted maximum likelihood method for estimation were used. Results One-hundred sixty-four studies, involving 218,035 participants, were located through the search process. The point prevalence of depression among women in low-income circumstances using self-report instruments in 134 studies was 37.4\% (95\% CI, 34.0\%–40.7\%). Additionally, the point prevalence according to depression diagnosis in 25 studies was 22.9\% (95\% CI, 17.8\%–28.5\%). Conclusions The high rate of depression among women living in low-income circumstances is of serious public health concern. Policy Implications Women living in low-income circumstances should receive screening and referral/treatment in not only medical service settings, but also in social service settings serving women receiving welfare benefits.},

	abstract = {How does unemployment insurance (UI) affect unemployed workers’ search behavior? Search models predict that until benefit exhaustion, UI depresses job search effort and increases reservation wages. Over an unemployment spell, search effort should increase up to benefit exhaustion and stay high thereafter. Meanwhile, reservation wages should decrease up to benefit exhaustion and stay low thereafter. To test these predictions, we link administrative registers to data on job search behavior from a major online job search platform in France. We follow over 400,000 workers, as long as they remain unemployed. We analyze the changes in search behavior around benefits exhaustion and take two steps to isolate the individual response to unemployment benefits. First, our longitudinal data allows us to correct for changes in sample composition over the spell. Second, we exploit data on workers eligible for 12–24 months of UI as well as workers ineligible for UI, to control for behavior changes over the unemployment spell that are independent of UI. Our results confirm the predictions of search models. We find that search effort (the number of job applications) increases by at least 50\% during the year preceding benefits exhaustion and remains high thereafter. The target monthly wage decreases by at least 2.4\% during the year preceding benefits exhaustion and remains low thereafter. In addition, we provide evidence for duration dependence: workers decrease the wage they target by 1.5\% over each year of unemployment, irrespective of their UI status.},

We find that, over the period 1910–1940, electrification increased the share of operatives in the average county by 3.5 percentage points and decreased the share of farmers by 2.9 percentage points. These effects are primarily driven by rural electrification, and they can account for more than half of the aggregate increase in operatives, and more than one quarter of the total decrease in farmers. These results suggest that electrification was a key contributor to U.S. structural transformation.},

	abstract = {While unemployment insurance (UI) could help attenuate racial income disparities in the U.S., Black unemployed workers seem to receive less UI benefits than White ones. To understand why, we analyze administrative data from random audits on UI claims in all U.S. states. We first document a large racial gap in the UI that unemployed workers receive after filing a new claim: Black claimants receive an 18:28\% (6:51ppt) lower replacement rate (i.e. benefits relative to prior wage) than White claimants. In principle, the replacement rate of each claimant mechanically depends on her work history (e.g. the earnings before job loss or the reason for separation from prior employer) and on the rules prevailing in her state. Since we observe claimants' UI-relevant work history and state, we are in a unique position to decompose the causes of the racial gap among UI claimants. First, we show that racial differences in work history prior to unemployment create a 10:16\% gap (3:62ppt); second, differences in rules across states create an 8:45\% gap (3:01ppt); finally, we find no residual racial gap, once we account for state rules and work history differences. Thus, the decentralized design of the UI system generates new gaps in income between Black and White claimants, even when they have the same work history. Our results highlight that, even in the absence of individual discrimination, institutions can perpetuate racial inequality.},

Regression discontinuity approaches are used to measure the local average treatment effect (LATE) and more recently also the Marginal Threshold Treatment Effect (MTTE), which shows how marginal changes in the threshold can affect the LATE. We extend this idea to define the problem of optimizing a policy threshold, i.e. selecting a threshold that optimizes the cumulative effect of the treatment on the treated. We present an estimator of the optimal threshold based on a constrained optimization framework. We show how to use machine learning (Gaussian process regression) for non-linear estimation. We also extend the estimation to a conservative threshold that is unlikely to produce harm, and we show how to include policy cost constraints. We apply these results to estimate an optimal tip-maximizing threshold for tip suggestions in taxi cabs Haggag (2014).},

	abstract = {In the late 2010s, foster care capacity was declining. In this study, we show that increasing the affordability of fostering a child could increase foster care capacity. We use administrative data from Adoption \& Foster Care Statistics (AFCARS) to examine the association between state-level economic factors and the number of children in foster care from 1996 to 2016. Using a panel regression, we found that a 10 \% increase in state foster care payments was associated with a 0.9 \% increase in the number of children in foster care in that state. As an example, North Carolina increased its payment rates to foster parents in 2008. Using a triple-difference strategy, we found that this increase led to a 20 \% increase in the number of children in foster care relative to children placed in other settings and relative to other states. Second, we examined the role of housing affordability: higher housing prices were associated with a lower number of children in foster care, consistent with the cost of space being a constraint for foster parents. Third, we examined the role of labor market opportunities: a higher minimum wage and higher female employment were associated with a greater number of children in foster care. This result is inconsistent with the idea that foster care is just a job, so that higher pay in other jobs and more time spent in employment would dissuade people from fostering a child. Instead, our results are consistent with foster parents acting out of altruism under financial constraints. Our results suggest that relaxing these financial constraints by, for example, increasing board rates enables people to act on their altruistic motives and foster a child.},

This landscape report summarizes the state of knowledge on the different pathways workers can use to exercise their power and voice to achieve higher wages and better working conditions. Higher wages allow workers and families to move out of poverty, avoid material hardship, and raise their living standards. Better working conditions can improve workers’ attachment to the labor force and make them more productive and loyal employees. We propose a two-part framework of how workers achieve greater power and mobility and in the labor market: (1) leaving one’s current job for a better option (referred to as “exit”) and, (2) organizations and institutions such as labor unions that allow workers to exercise their voice in the workplace, including through input on working conditions and firm decisions (referred to as “voice”). We review empirical evidence on the market forces and policies that allow workers to express power through exit. We also summarize evidence on major institutions and policies that enable workers to gain power through voice.},

In the most concentrated labor markets, employment rises following a minimum wage increase. The paper establishes its main findings studying the effects of local minimum wage increases on a key low-wage retail sector, and using data on labor market concentration that covers the entirety of the United States with fine spatial variation at the occupation level. The results carry over to the fast-food sector and the entire low-wage labor market, and are robust to using proxies of labor market concentration available for a broader range of industries, such as the number of establishments and population density. A model of oligosponistic competition can explain these effects: there is more room to increase wages in high concentration areas where wages tend to be further below marginal productivity. These findings provide evidence supporting monopsonistic wage setting as an explanation for the near-zero minimum wage employment effect documented in prior work.},

We use data on nearly all jobs posted online in the United States, as collected by Burning Glass Technologies, and we create a new measure of green jobs, defined here as solar and wind jobs. We use job titles and task requirements to define green jobs. We find that both solar and wind job postings have more than tripled since 2010, with solar jobs seeing especially strong growth that precedes the growth of new installed solar capacity. In 2019, we identify approximately 52,500 solar job openings and 13,500 wind job openings. Solar jobs are mostly (33\%) in sales occupations and in the utilities industry (16\%). Wind jobs are most represented among installation and maintenance occupations (37\%) and in the manufacturing industry (29\%). Green jobs are created in occupations that are about 21\% higher paying than average. The pay premium is even higher for jobs with a low educational requirement. Finally, green jobs tend to locate in counties with high shares of employment in fossil fuel extraction. Overall, our results suggest that the growth of renewable energy leads to the creation of relatively high-paying jobs, which are more often than not located in areas that stand to lose from a decline in fossil fuel extraction jobs.},

To understand why, we study Washington State’s two failed carbon tax referendums from 2016 and 2018—the first such votes in the United States. We find that average voters’ opposition to the carbon tax can partly be explained by the anticipation of higher energy costs. Meanwhile, ideology—as measured by voting on other initiatives—explains 90\% of variation in voting across precincts. These results suggest that ideology plays a crucial role in driving opposition to carbon taxes. We find that revenue recycling interacts with ideology: conservatives preferred the 2016 revenue-neutral policy, while liberals preferred the 2018 green-spending policy. Finally, we forecast that no other state is liberal enough to pass Washington’s policies. Thus, opinion surveys showing majority support for the carbon tax can be misleading.},

We review three theoretical frameworks explaining monopsony power. Oligopsony models attribute it to strategic interactions among a limited number of firms. Job differentiation models cite imperfect job substitution and heterogeneous worker preferences. Search-and-matching models point to search frictions hindering instantaneous access to all available jobs. We then develop a theory-informed discussion of the empirical evidence on antitrust policies, policies that reduce barriers to job switching, and policies countering monopsony\&apos;s effects on workers. Preventing mergers and regulating noncompetition agreements can increase wages by preserving competition among employers. Minimum wages can mitigate the effect of monopsony power by increasing wages without reducing employment. The insights garnered from both theoretical models and empirical evidence offer a road map for crafting policies that can enhance competition in the labor market.},

	abstract = {Due to a lack of competition among employers in the labor market, employers have monopsony power, or power to pay workers less than what the workers contribute to the employers' bottomline. "Worker power" is workers' ability to obtain higher wages and better working conditions. While the antitrust agencies have just begun developing policy and enforcement strategies to regulate employer monopsony, broader government policies that impact market forces, the formation of labor market institutions, and workers' voices and exit options also play a defining role in shaping worker power relative to employers. For example, in addition to antitrust enforcement, worker power can be enhanced by labor agencies' regulation of employer/employee status, wage and working condition floors, and workers' collective action. Worker power can also be enhanced by agencies administering social safety net protections and influencing labor market tightness through monetary policy. Scholars have yet to assess how federal agencies, whose statutory authority and regulatory purview impact worker power, could best direct their authority, regulatory tools, and expertise towards labor market regulation in the presence of employer monopsony power. This Essay outlines the comparative advantages of federal agencies' regulations impacting worker power. It then develops a checklist of worker power indicators for agencies to track and operationalize in high-priority policy and enforcement areas and offers a broader worker power agenda through a whole-of-government approach involving interagency coordination to protect and strengthen workers' voice and exit options.},

Substantively, we find that racial differences in human capital (education) play an essential role in explaining the gap in volunteering. Furthermore, stark differences appear when we examine where volunteering takes place: Black people are more likely to volunteer in religious instead of secular venues.

	abstract = {Labor economics often assumes that wages w are equal to the marginal revenue product of labor MRPL. However, recent literature has shown that firms’ market power allows them to pay wages substantially below marginal productivity. The markdown (MRPL − w)/w is our preferred measure of firms’ monopsony power, and captures the percent wage increase that would occur if monopsony power were eliminated. We derive the markdown across three classes of models, each embodying a distinct source of monopsony power. First, in oligopsony models, monopsony power arises from strategic interactions between large firms, and is related to labor market concentration. Second, in job differentiation models, monopsony power arises from workers’ heterogeneous preferences over jobs that differ in wages and amenities. Finally, in search and matching models, it arises from frictions that prevent workers from accessing all existing job vacancies. To identify the markdown, empirical studies often rely on estimating the firm-level labor supply elasticity and taking its inverse as a measure of the markdown. A few studies directly estimate MRPL using a production function approach. Across studies, the markdown typically ranges between 15 \% and 50 \% implying that wages would increase by 15 to 50 \% if firms’ monopsony power were eliminated. Finally, we analyze the policy implications of monopsony power in three areas, drawing on both theory and empirical analysis: merger control in antitrust policy, the regulation of non-competition agreements, and minimum wages. Monopsony power helps explain how mergers and non-competition agreements can lower wages, and how minimum wages can increase employment. Overall, the literature shows that monopsony power is significant, and should be considered when analyzing policy and the sources of wage variation.},

	abstract = {Care infrastructures are essential for supporting families and enabling women’s participation in the labor market, but they also have implications for family income inequality. This article examines access to childcare services in the United States as a case study. We propose that market-priced childcare systems generate inequalities in how births affect mothers’ contributions to family income, because they constrain post-birth labor supply for lower-income women more than for higher-income women, and aggravate family income inequality as a result. Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged with state-level childcare prices, we estimate individual fixed-effects regression models for the consequences of births on family income and its proximate determinants: mothers’ labor supply and earnings, and partners’ labor supply and earnings. We find that childcare prices increase post-birth earnings losses for mothers without college degrees, but not for mothers with college degrees, and these losses are not compensated for by increases in partners’ earnings or by income transfers. As a result, childcare costs exacerbate family income gaps between partnered women with and without a college degree by 34 percentage points.},
