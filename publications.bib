	abstract = {The author investigates whether judges deciding on unfair dismissal cases are sensitive to economic conditions faced by workers and firms. Using the 1992 survey of Employment Tribunal Applications in Great Britain and controlling for case selection, she finds that both the unemployment and the bankruptcy rates significantly decrease the probability of judges deciding in favor of dismissed employees. A one-point increase in the unemployment rate leads to a seven-point decrease in this probability; this effect, however, is not significant for unemployed workers. These findings are consistent with the idea that judges, while tailoring firing costs to economic circumstances, are somewhat more sensitive to firms' interests.},

It uses a 1999 British reform that increased job security for workers with 1–2 years of tenure. The firing hazard for these workers decreased by 26\% relative to the hazard for workers with 2–4 years of tenure. The firing hazard for workers with 0–1 year of tenure also decreased by 19\%, which is consistent with better recruitment practices and hence improved match quality.},

We develop new yearly estimates of the countercyclicality of the budget deficit and show that the budget deficit has become increasingly countercyclical in most OECD countries over the past twenty years. However, European Monetary Union (EMU) countries did not become more countercyclical. Using panel specifications with country- and year-fixed effects, we show that: (a) an increase in financial development, a decrease in openness to trade, and the adoption of an inflation-targeting regime move countries toward a more countercyclical budget deficit; (b) a more countercyclical budget deficit has a positive and significant effect on economic growth, and this effect is larger when financial development is lower.},

	abstract = {We use data on publicly traded U.K. firms to investigate whether financing choices differ systematically with R\&D intensity. As well as looking at a balance sheet measure of the debt/assets ratio, we also consider the probability of raising finance by issuing new equity, and the shares of bank debt and secured debt in total debt. We find a nonlinear relationship with the debt/assets ratio: firms that report positive but low R\&D use more debt finance than firms that report no R\&D, but the use of debt finance falls with R\&D intensity among those firms that report R\&D. We find a simpler relationship with the probability of issuing new equity: Firms that report R\&D are more likely to raise funds by issuing shares than firms that report no R\&D, and this probability increases with R\&D intensity. The shares of bank debt and secured debt in total debt are both lower for firms that report R\&D compared to those that do not, and tend to fall as R\&D intensity rises. We discuss possible explanations for these patterns.},

Students believe that salaries are 13\% higher than they actually are, on average, and students underestimate the probability of being employed by almost 25\%. We find that the main determinants of major choice are beliefs about course enjoyment and grades, but expected labor market outcomes also matter. Experimental estimates of the impact of expected labor market outcomes are larger than OLS estimates and show that a 10\% increase in salary is associated with a 14 to 18\% increase in the probability of choosing a specific category of majors.},

Highly concentrated markets account for 16\% of employment. Labor market concentration is negatively correlated with wages, and there is no relationship between measured concentration and an occupation’s skill level.

	abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for measuring the efficacy of medical interventions. However, RCTs are expensive, and use a limited population. Techniques to estimate the effects of stroke interventions from observational data that minimize confounding would be useful. We used regression discontinuity design (RDD), a technique well-established in economics, on the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) data set. RDD, based on regression, measures the occurrence of a discontinuity in an outcome (e.g., home discharge) as a function of an intervention (e.g., alteplase) that becomes significantly more likely when crossing the threshold of a continuous variable (e.g., time from symptom onset). The technique assumes that patients near either side of a threshold (e.g., 2.99 and 3.01 hours from symptom onset) are indistinguishable other than the use of the treatment. We compared outcomes of patients whose estimated onset to treatment time fell on either side of the treatment threshold for three cohorts of patients in the GWTG-Stroke data set that spanned different treatment thresholds for alteplase (3 hours, 2003-2007, N=1869; 3 hours, 2009-2016, N=13,086, and 4.5 hours, 2009-2016, N=6,550). Patient demographic characteristics were overall similar across the treatment thresholds. We did not find evidence of a discontinuity in discharge disposition at any treatment threshold attributable to alteplase. Potential reasons for failing to find an effect include violation of some RDD assumptions in clinical care and large sample sizes required.},

Developing countries are currently making huge investments in this general-purpose technology, with a view to achieving structural change. What can history teach us about its impact on the structure of employment? We use U.S. Census data and an identification strategy based on hydroelectric potential to identify the effects of the geographic expansion of higher-voltage electricity lines. We find that, over the period 1910–1940, electrification increased the share of operatives in the average county by 3.5 percentage points and decreased the share of farmers by 2.9 percentage points. These effects are primarily driven by rural electrification, and they can account for more than half of the aggregate increase in operatives, and more than one quarter of the total decrease in farmers. These results suggest that electrification was a key contributor to U.S. structural transformation.},

	abstract = {How does unemployment insurance (UI) affect unemployed workers’ search behavior? Search models predict that until benefit exhaustion, UI depresses job search effort and increases reservation wages. Over an unemployment spell, search effort should increase up to benefit exhaustion and stay high thereafter. Meanwhile, reservation wages should decrease up to benefit exhaustion and stay low thereafter. To test these predictions, we link administrative registers to data on job search behavior from a major online job search platform in France. We follow over 400,000 workers, as long as they remain unemployed. We analyze the changes in search behavior around benefits exhaustion and take two steps to isolate the individual response to unemployment benefits. First, our longitudinal data allows us to correct for changes in sample composition over the spell. Second, we exploit data on workers eligible for 12–24 months of UI as well as workers ineligible for UI, to control for behavior changes over the unemployment spell that are independent of UI. Our results confirm the predictions of search models. We find that search effort (the number of job applications) increases by at least 50\% during the year preceding benefits exhaustion and remains high thereafter. The target monthly wage decreases by at least 2.4\% during the year preceding benefits exhaustion and remains low thereafter. In addition, we provide evidence for duration dependence: workers decrease the wage they target by 1.5\% over each year of unemployment, irrespective of their UI status.},

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) increased US unemployment benefits by \$600 a week. Theory predicts that FPUC should decrease job applications, while the effect on vacancy creation is ambiguous. We estimate the effect of FPUC on job applications and vacancy creation week by week, from March to July 2020, using granular data from the online jobs platform Glassdoor. We exploit variation in the proportional increase in benefits across local labor markets. To isolate the effect of FPUC, we flexibly allow for different trends in local labor markets differentially exposed to the COVID-19 crisis. We verify that trends in outcomes prior to the FPUC do not correlate with future increases in benefits, which supports our identification assumption. First, we find that a 10\% increase in unemployment benefits caused a 3.6\% decline in applications, but did not decrease vacancy creation; hence, FPUC increased labor market tightness (vacancies/applications). Second, we document that tightness was unusually depressed during the FPUC period. Altogether, our results imply that the positive effect of FPUC on tightness was likely welfare improving: FPUC decreased competition among applicants at a time when jobs were unusually scarce. Our results also help explain prior findings that FPUC did not decrease employment.},

In the most concentrated labor markets, employment rises following a minimum wage increase. The paper establishes its main findings studying the effects of local minimum wage increases on a key low-wage retail sector, and using data on labor market concentration that covers the entirety of the United States with fine spatial variation at the occupation level. The results carry over to the fast-food sector and the entire low-wage labor market, and are robust to using proxies of labor market concentration available for a broader range of industries, such as the number of establishments and population density. A model of oligosponistic competition can explain these effects: there is more room to increase wages in high concentration areas where wages tend to be further below marginal productivity. These findings provide evidence supporting monopsonistic wage setting as an explanation for the near-zero minimum wage employment effect documented in prior work.},

We review three theoretical frameworks explaining monopsony power. Oligopsony models attribute it to strategic interactions among a limited number of firms. Job differentiation models cite imperfect job substitution and heterogeneous worker preferences. Search-and-matching models point to search frictions hindering instantaneous access to all available jobs. We then develop a theory-informed discussion of the empirical evidence on antitrust policies, policies that reduce barriers to job switching, and policies countering monopsony\&apos;s effects on workers. Preventing mergers and regulating noncompetition agreements can increase wages by preserving competition among employers. Minimum wages can mitigate the effect of monopsony power by increasing wages without reducing employment. The insights garnered from both theoretical models and empirical evidence offer a road map for crafting policies that can enhance competition in the labor market.},
