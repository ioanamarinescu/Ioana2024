abstract: The HIV epidemic has dramatically decreased labor supply among prime-age
  adults in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using within-country variation in regional HIV prevalence
  and a synthetic panel, I find that HIV significantly increases the capitalâ€“labor
  ratio in urban manufacturing firms. The impact of HIV on average wages is positive
  but imprecisely estimated. In contrast, HIV has a large positive impact on the skill
  premium. The impact of HIV on the wages of low skilled workers is insignificantly
  different from 0, and is strongly dampened by competition from rural migrants. The
  HIV epidemic disproportionately increases the incomes of high-skilled survivors,
  thus increasing inequality.
