abstract: 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation
  (FPUC) increased US unemployment benefits by $600 a week. Theory predicts that FPUC
  should decrease job applications, while the effect on vacancy creation is ambiguous.
  We estimate the effect of FPUC on job applications and vacancy creation week by
  week, from March to July 2020, using granular data from the online jobs platform
  Glassdoor. We exploit variation in the proportional increase in benefits across
  local labor markets. To isolate the effect of FPUC, we flexibly allow for different
  trends in local labor markets differentially exposed to the COVID-19 crisis. We
  verify that trends in outcomes prior to the FPUC do not correlate with future increases
  in benefits, which supports our identification assumption. First, we find that a
  10% increase in unemployment benefits caused a 3.6% decline in applications, but
  did not decrease vacancy creation; hence, FPUC increased labor market tightness
  (vacancies/applications). Second, we document that tightness was unusually depressed
  during the FPUC period. Altogether, our results imply that the positive effect of
  FPUC on tightness was likely welfare improving: FPUC decreased competition among
  applicants at a time when jobs were unusually scarce. Our results also help explain
  prior findings that FPUC did not decrease employment.'
