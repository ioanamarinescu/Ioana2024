abstract: 'Do racial disparities in the paid labor market also extend to the unpaid
  labor market? Using American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data, we find that Black people
  spend 13% less time at work than white people, and 17% less time in volunteering.
  Using an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we show that differences in observable characteristics
  explain away the racial gap in volunteering. By contrast, the gap in paid work cannot
  be explained away, consistent with broader racial disparities in the labor market.
  Substantively, we find that racial differences in human capital (education) play
  an essential role in explaining the gap in volunteering. Furthermore, stark differences
  appear when we examine where volunteering takes place: Black people are more likely
  to volunteer in religious instead of secular venues. Our results suggest that structural
  inequalities in education and volunteering opportunities feed into racial gaps in
  both paid and unpaid work.'
