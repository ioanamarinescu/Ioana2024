abstract: Social protection systems in developing countries are typically composed
  of a bundle of benefits, the major ones being health insurance and pensions. Benefit
  bundling may increase informality and decrease welfare. Indeed, if some of the benefits
  are valued at substantially less than their cost, workers may choose to forego all
  benefits, even though some other benefits are valued at or above their cost. We
  examine the impact of benefit bundling using a series of Colombian reforms. The
  key reform is the unification of the payment systems for health and pension, which
  made it more difficult to contribute differently to the one plan versus the other.
  Using the progressive roll-out of the unified payment system by firm size, we show
  that benefit bundling increases both full formality and full informality by about
  1 percentage point. The increase in full formality is concentrated among salaried
  workers in small to medium firms, while the increase in full informality is concentrated
  among independent workers.
