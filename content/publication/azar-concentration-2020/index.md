abstract: Using data on the near-universe of US online job vacancies collected by
  Burning Glass Technologies in 2016, we calculate labor market concentration using
  the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) for each commuting zone by 6-digit SOC occupation.
  The average market has an HHI of 4,378, or the equivalent of 2.3 recruiting employers.
  60% of labor markets are highly concentrated (above 2500 HHI). Highly concentrated
  markets account for 16% of employment. Labor market concentration is negatively
  correlated with wages, and there is no relationship between measured concentration
  and an occupation’s skill level. These indicators suggest that employer concentration
  is a meaningful measure of employer power in labor markets, that there is a high
  degree of employer power in labor markets, and also that it varies widely across
  occupations and geography.
