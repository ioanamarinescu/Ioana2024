abstract: How does employer market power affect workers? We compute the concentration
  of new hires by occupation and commuting zone in France using linked employer-employee
  data. Using instrumental variables, we find that a 10% increase in labor market
  concentration decreases hires by 3.2% and their hourly wage by nearly 0.5%, as hypothesized
  by monopsony theory. Based on a simple merger simulation, we find that a merger
  between the top two employers in the retail industry would be most damaging, with
  about 30 million euros in annual loss to the wage bill of new hires, and a 3000
  decrease in annual hires.
