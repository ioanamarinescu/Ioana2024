abstract: Since 1982, all Alaskan residents have received a yearly cash dividend from
  the Alaska Permanent Fund. Using the Current Population Survey and a synthetic control
  method, this paper shows that the dividend had no effect on employment and increased
  part-time work by 1.8 percentage points (17 percent). A calibration of microeconomic
  and macroeconomic effects suggests that the empirical results are consistent with
  cash stimulating the local economyâ€”a general equilibrium effect. Nontradable sectors
  have a more positive employment response than tradable sectors. Overall, the results
  suggest that a universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease
  aggregate employment.
