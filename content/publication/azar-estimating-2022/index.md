abstract: Job differentiation gives employers market power, allowing them to pay workers
  less than their marginal productivity. We estimate a differentiated jobs model using
  application data from Careerbuilder.com. We find direct evidence of substantial
  job differentiation. Without the use of instruments for wages, job applications
  appear very inelastic with respect to wages. Plausible instruments produce elastic
  firm-level application supply curves. Under some assumptions, the implied market
  level labor supply elasticity is 0.5, while the firm level labor elasticity is 4.8.
  This suggests that workers may produce 21% more than their wage level, consistent
  with significant monopsony power.
