abstract: A product market is concentrated when a few firms dominate the market. Similarly,
  a labor market is concentrated when a few firms dominate hiring in the market. Using
  data from the leading employment website CareerBuilder.com, we calculate labor market
  concentration for more than 8,000 geographic–occupational labor markets in the United
  States. Based on the Department of Justice–Federal Trade Commission horizontal merger
  guidelines, the average market is highly concentrated. Going from the 25th percentile
  to the 75th percentile in concentration is associated with a 5 percent (OLS) to
  17 percent (IV) decline in posted wages, suggesting that concentration increases
  labor market power.
