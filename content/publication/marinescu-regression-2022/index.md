abstract: Treatments often come with thresholds, e.g. we are given statins if our
  cholesterol is above a certain threshold. But which statin administration threshold
  maximizes our quality of life adjusted years? More generally, which threshold would
  optimize the average expected outcome? Regression discontinuity approaches are used
  to measure the local average treatment effect (LATE) and more recently also the
  Marginal Threshold Treatment Effect (MTTE), which shows how marginal changes in
  the threshold can affect the LATE. We extend this idea to define the problem of
  optimizing a policy threshold, i.e. selecting a threshold that optimizes the cumulative
  effect of the treatment on the treated. We present an estimator of the optimal threshold
  based on a constrained optimization framework. We show how to use machine learning
  (Gaussian process regression) for non-linear estimation. We also extend the estimation
  to a conservative threshold that is unlikely to produce harm, and we show how to
  include policy cost constraints. We apply these results to estimate an optimal tip-maximizing
  threshold for tip suggestions in taxi cabs Haggag (2014).
