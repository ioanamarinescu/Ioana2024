abstract: In the past year, Division economists have contributed to the Division’s
  many investigations and enforcement actions. This review highlights several of the
  Division’s enforcement efforts that have confronted issues of labor market competition,
  as well as a merger challenge that focused on the Division’s theory of harm that
  would occur before the merger was consummated.
