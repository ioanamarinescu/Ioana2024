abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for
  measuring the efficacy of medical interventions. However, RCTs are expensive, and
  use a limited population. Techniques to estimate the effects of stroke interventions
  from observational data that minimize confounding would be useful. We used regression
  discontinuity design (RDD), a technique well-established in economics, on the Get
  With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) data set. RDD, based on regression, measures
  the occurrence of a discontinuity in an outcome (e.g., home discharge) as a function
  of an intervention (e.g., alteplase) that becomes significantly more likely when
  crossing the threshold of a continuous variable (e.g., time from symptom onset).
  The technique assumes that patients near either side of a threshold (e.g., 2.99
  and 3.01 hours from symptom onset) are indistinguishable other than the use of the
  treatment. We compared outcomes of patients whose estimated onset to treatment time
  fell on either side of the treatment threshold for three cohorts of patients in
  the GWTG-Stroke data set that spanned different treatment thresholds for alteplase
  (3 hours, 2003-2007, N=1869; 3 hours, 2009-2016, N=13,086, and 4.5 hours, 2009-2016,
  N=6,550). Patient demographic characteristics were overall similar across the treatment
  thresholds. We did not find evidence of a discontinuity in discharge disposition
  at any treatment threshold attributable to alteplase. Potential reasons for failing
  to find an effect include violation of some RDD assumptions in clinical care and
  large sample sizes required.
