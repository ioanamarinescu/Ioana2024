abstract: The author investigates whether judges deciding on unfair dismissal cases
  are sensitive to economic conditions faced by workers and firms. Using the 1992
  survey of Employment Tribunal Applications in Great Britain and controlling for
  case selection, she finds that both the unemployment and the bankruptcy rates significantly
  decrease the probability of judges deciding in favor of dismissed employees. A one-point
  increase in the unemployment rate leads to a seven-point decrease in this probability;
  this effect, however, is not significant for unemployed workers. These findings
  are consistent with the idea that judges, while tailoring firing costs to economic
  circumstances, are somewhat more sensitive to firms' interests.
