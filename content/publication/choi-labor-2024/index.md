abstract: Involuntary part-time employment is a measure of labor market slack that
  goes beyond the unemployment rate, and broadens our understanding of the state of
  the labor market. Our study investigates the determinants of the involuntary part-time
  employment share (i.e., the proportion of involuntary part-time workers in all employment)
  by accounting for both labor supply (unemployment) and labor demand (job vacancies).
  We use big data on the near universe of online job vacancies collected by Lightcast
  and the Current Population Survey from 2003 to 2021. We find that, within a commuting
  zone by Census occupation cell, a 10% increase in the unemployment rate increases
  the involuntary part-time share by 0.19 percentage points, while a 10% increase
  in job vacancies decreases the involuntary part-time share by 0.07 percentage points.
  We also provide suggestive evidence that higher labor market concentration, which
  is indicative of greater labor market power, may raise involuntary part-time employment.
  Overall, we conclude that higher labor supply and lower labor demand increase involuntary
  part-time employment.
