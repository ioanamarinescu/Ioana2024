abstract: "While unemployment insurance (UI) could help attenuate racial income disparities
  in the U.S., Black unemployed workers seem to receive less UI benefits than White
  ones. To understand why, we analyze administrative data from random audits on UI
  claims in all U.S. states. We first document a large racial gap in the UI that unemployed
  workers receive after filing a new claim: Black claimants receive an 18:28% (6:51ppt)
  lower replacement rate (i.e. benefits relative to prior wage) than White claimants.
  In principle, the replacement rate of each claimant mechanically depends on her
  work history (e.g. the earnings before job loss or the reason for separation from
  prior employer) and on the rules prevailing in her state. Since we observe claimants'
  UI-relevant work history and state, we are in a unique position to decompose the
  causes of the racial gap among UI claimants. First, we show that racial differences
  in work history prior to unemployment create a 10:16% gap (3:62ppt); second, differences
  in rules across states create an 8:45% gap (3:01ppt); finally, we find no residual
  racial gap, once we account for state rules and work history differences. Thus,
  the decentralized design of the UI system generates new gaps in income between Black
  and White claimants, even when they have the same work history. Our results highlight
  that, even in the absence of individual discrimination, institutions can perpetuate
  racial inequality."
