abstract: Although online employer reviews are widely used, they may not be representative
  because employees with extreme opinions are more likely to post online reviews than
  employees with moderate opinions, resulting in more extreme reviews. We Ô¨Ånd that
  providing incentives for reviewing can reduce this selection bias and make online
  reviews more representative, and more useful.
