abstract: 'Care infrastructures are essential for supporting families and enabling
  women’s participation in the labor market, but they also have implications for family
  income inequality. This article examines access to childcare services in the United
  States as a case study. We propose that market-priced childcare systems generate
  inequalities in how births affect mothers’ contributions to family income, because
  they constrain post-birth labor supply for lower-income women more than for higher-income
  women, and aggravate family income inequality as a result. Using the Survey of Income
  and Program Participation (SIPP) merged with state-level childcare prices, we estimate
  individual fixed-effects regression models for the consequences of births on family
  income and its proximate determinants: mothers’ labor supply and earnings, and partners’
  labor supply and earnings. We find that childcare prices increase post-birth earnings
  losses for mothers without college degrees, but not for mothers with college degrees,
  and these losses are not compensated for by increases in partners’ earnings or by
  income transfers. As a result, childcare costs exacerbate family income gaps between
  partnered women with and without a college degree by 34 percentage points.'
