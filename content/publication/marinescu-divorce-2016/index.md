abstract: Learning about marriage quality has been proposed as a key mechanism for
  explaining how the probability of divorce evolves with marriage duration, and why
  people often cohabit before getting married. I develop four theoretical models of
  divorce, three of which include learning. I use data from the Survey of Income and
  Program Participation to test reduced form implications of these models. The data
  is inconsistent with models including a substantial amount of learning. On the other
  hand, the data is consistent with a model without any learning, but where marriage
  quality changes over time.
