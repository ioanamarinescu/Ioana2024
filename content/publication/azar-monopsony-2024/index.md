abstract: 'Labor markets are not perfectly competitive: Monopsony power enables employers
  to pay workers less than the marginal revenue product of labor. We review three
  theoretical frameworks explaining monopsony power. Oligopsony models attribute it
  to strategic interactions among a limited number of firms. Job differentiation models
  cite imperfect job substitution and heterogeneous worker preferences. Search-and-matching
  models point to search frictions hindering instantaneous access to all available
  jobs. We then develop a theory-informed discussion of the empirical evidence on
  antitrust policies, policies that reduce barriers to job switching, and policies
  countering monopsony&apos;s effects on workers. Preventing mergers and regulating
  noncompetition agreements can increase wages by preserving competition among employers.
  Minimum wages can mitigate the effect of monopsony power by increasing wages without
  reducing employment. The insights garnered from both theoretical models and empirical
  evidence offer a road map for crafting policies that can enhance competition in
  the labor market.'
