abstract: 'Economists recommend Pigouvian taxes as the most efficient way to fight
  climate change. Yet, carbon taxes are difficult to implement politically. To understand
  why, we study Washington State’s two failed carbon tax referendums from 2016 and
  2018—the first such votes in the United States. We find that average voters’ opposition
  to the carbon tax can partly be explained by the anticipation of higher energy costs.
  Meanwhile, ideology—as measured by voting on other initiatives—explains 90% of variation
  in voting across precincts. These results suggest that ideology plays a crucial
  role in driving opposition to carbon taxes. We find that revenue recycling interacts
  with ideology: conservatives preferred the 2016 revenue-neutral policy, while liberals
  preferred the 2018 green-spending policy. Finally, we forecast that no other state
  is liberal enough to pass Washington’s policies. Thus, opinion surveys showing majority
  support for the carbon tax can be misleading.'
