abstract: Electricity was the catalyst for the second industrial revolution in the
  early twentieth century. Developing countries are currently making huge investments
  in this general-purpose technology, with a view to achieving structural change.
  What can history teach us about its impact on the structure of employment? We use
  U.S. Census data and an identification strategy based on hydroelectric potential
  to identify the effects of the geographic expansion of higher-voltage electricity
  lines. We find that, over the period 1910â€“1940, electrification increased the share
  of operatives in the average county by 3.5 percentage points and decreased the share
  of farmers by 2.9 percentage points. These effects are primarily driven by rural
  electrification, and they can account for more than half of the aggregate increase
  in operatives, and more than one quarter of the total decrease in farmers. These
  results suggest that electrification was a key contributor to U.S. structural transformation.
