abstract: The publication of the 2023 Merger Guidelines (MG) by the DOJ and FTC marked
  a significant event in the expanding influence of economics on public guidance in
  antitrust. The economic frameworks that are outlined in the MG are not limited to
  purely horizontal or vertical mergers. The MG more explicitly embrace an approach
  of assessing risk of harm to competition, which in turn supports the consideration
  of dynamic theories such as entrenchment or expansion of market power. The MG also
  elaborate on mergers that involve multi-product firms, platforms, and labor market
  competition. During this eventful year, the Division also successfully blocked JetBlue’s
  proposed acquisition of Spirit and obtained conduct relief to protect a specific
  type of labor market – chicken growers – from anticompetitive conduct by processors
  who compete for their services.
