abstract: During the Great Recession, U.S. unemployment benefits were extended by
  up to 73 weeks. Theory predicts that extensions increase unemployment by discouraging
  job search, a partial equilibrium effect. Using data from the large job board CareerBuilder.com,
  I find that a 10% increase in benefit duration decreased state-level job applications
  by 1%, but had no robust effect on job vacancies. Job seekers thus faced reduced
  competition for jobs, a general equilibrium effect. Calibration implies that the
  general equilibrium effect reduces the impact of unemployment insurance on unemployment
  by 39%.
