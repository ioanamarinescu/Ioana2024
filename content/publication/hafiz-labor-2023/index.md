abstract: Due to a lack of competition among employers in the labor market, employers
  have monopsony power, or power to pay workers less than what the workers contribute
  to the employers' bottomline. \"Worker power\" is workers' ability to obtain higher
  wages and better working conditions. While the antitrust agencies have just begun
  developing policy and enforcement strategies to regulate employer monopsony, broader
  government policies that impact market forces, the formation of labor market institutions,
  and workers' voices and exit options also play a defining role in shaping worker
  power relative to employers. For example, in addition to antitrust enforcement,
  worker power can be enhanced by labor agencies' regulation of employer/employee
  status, wage and working condition floors, and workers' collective action. Worker
  power can also be enhanced by agencies administering social safety net protections
  and influencing labor market tightness through monetary policy. Scholars have yet
  to assess how federal agencies, whose statutory authority and regulatory purview
  impact worker power, could best direct their authority, regulatory tools, and expertise
  towards labor market regulation in the presence of employer monopsony power. This
  Essay outlines the comparative advantages of federal agencies' regulations impacting
  worker power. It then develops a checklist of worker power indicators for agencies
  to track and operationalize in high-priority policy and enforcement areas and offers
  a broader worker power agenda through a whole-of-government approach involving interagency
  coordination to protect and strengthen workers' voice and exit options.
