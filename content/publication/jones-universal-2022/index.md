abstract: 'By stimulating consumer spending, unconditional cash transfers may increase
  price levels. In Alaska, residents have received an unconditional cash transfer
  every year since 1982: the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend. We measure the impact
  of the dividend using a synthetic control method, which matches Alaska with similar
  states prior to the introduction of the dividend. The method does not find a good
  control group for Alaska, likely because of unusual inflation dynamics around 1982.
  While there is suggestive evidence of positive inflation and price effects, much
  uncertainty remains regarding the causal effect of unconditional cash transfers
  on Alaskan inflation and prices.'
