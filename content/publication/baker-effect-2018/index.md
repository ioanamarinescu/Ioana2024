abstract: An important goal of community colleges is to prepare students for the labor
  market. But are students aware of the labor market outcomes in different majors?
  And how much do students weigh labor market outcomes when choosing a major? In this
  study we find that less than 15% of a sample of community college students in California
  rank broad categories of majors accurately in terms of labor market outcomes. Students
  believe that salaries are 13% higher than they actually are, on average, and students
  underestimate the probability of being employed by almost 25%. We find that the
  main determinants of major choice are beliefs about course enjoyment and grades,
  but expected labor market outcomes also matter. Experimental estimates of the impact
  of expected labor market outcomes are larger than OLS estimates and show that a
  10% increase in salary is associated with a 14 to 18% increase in the probability
  of choosing a specific category of majors.
