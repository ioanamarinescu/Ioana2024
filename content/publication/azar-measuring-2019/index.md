abstract: We compute the \"applications elasticity\" as a proxy for firm-level labor
  supply elasticity by regressing the applications to a given job on the posted wage.
  The average applications elasticity in our data is 0.42. We then relate our elasticity
  estimates to concentration in labor markets defined by six-digit SOC occupations
  and commuting zone. We show a robust negative relationship between the two. Applications
  elasticity is near zero for all but the most densely populated labor markets, suggesting
  that 80 percent of the workforce works in labor markets where employers exercise
  significant monopsony power.
