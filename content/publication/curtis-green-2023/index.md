abstract: Does the growth of renewable energy benefit US workers, and which workers
  stand to benefit the most? Until now, evidence on green energy jobs has been limited
  due to measurement issues. We use data on nearly all jobs posted online in the United
  States, as collected by Burning Glass Technologies, and we create a new measure
  of green jobs, defined here as solar and wind jobs. We use job titles and task requirements
  to define green jobs. We find that both solar and wind job postings have more than
  tripled since 2010, with solar jobs seeing especially strong growth that precedes
  the growth of new installed solar capacity. In 2019, we identify approximately 52,500
  solar job openings and 13,500 wind job openings. Solar jobs are mostly (33%) in
  sales occupations and in the utilities industry (16%). Wind jobs are most represented
  among installation and maintenance occupations (37%) and in the manufacturing industry
  (29%). Green jobs are created in occupations that are about 21% higher paying than
  average. The pay premium is even higher for jobs with a low educational requirement.
  Finally, green jobs tend to locate in counties with high shares of employment in
  fossil fuel extraction. Overall, our results suggest that the growth of renewable
  energy leads to the creation of relatively high-paying jobs, which are more often
  than not located in areas that stand to lose from a decline in fossil fuel extraction
  jobs.
