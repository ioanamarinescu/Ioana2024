abstract: 'Wage inequality does not fully capture differences in job quality. Jobs
  also differ along other key dimensions, including the prevalence of labor rights
  violations. We construct novel measures of labor violation rates using data from
  federal agencies. Within local industries over time, a 10% increase in the average
  wage is associated with a 0.15% decrease in the number of violations per employee
  and a 4% decrease in fines per dollar of pay. Reduced labor market concentration
  and increased union coverage rate are also associated with reductions in labor violations.
  Overall, labor violations are regressive: they increase inequality in job quality.'
