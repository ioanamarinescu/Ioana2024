abstract: Building upon the Job Demands-Resources model, this study examines the relationships
  among precarious work schedules, work attendance anxiety, and employer support during
  the early COVID-19 pandemic. For part-time retail workers, the prevalence of precarious
  work schedules has been a persistent problem. Additionally, new challenges such
  as work attendance anxiety and lack of employer support emerged during the COVID-19
  pandemic. Data were collected through an online survey on the Amazon Mechanical
  Turk platform. Between July and August 2020, we secured a sample of U.S. part-time
  workers in “food and beverage retail stores” (N = 179). Using Ordinary Least Squares
  regression analyses, we find that work attendance anxiety, lack of control over
  work hours, and non-standard working hours are negatively associated with job satisfaction.
  In terms of employer support, personal protective equipment is associated with lower
  levels of work attendance anxiety and alleviates the impact of work attendance anxiety
  on job satisfaction. The findings provide valuable insights for employers and managers
  aiming to enhance job satisfaction and effectively respond to challenges posed by
  health crises.
