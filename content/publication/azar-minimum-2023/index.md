abstract: 'This paper shows that more highly concentrated labor markets experience
  more positive employment effects of the minimum wage. In the most concentrated labor
  markets, employment rises following a minimum wage increase. The paper establishes
  its main findings studying the effects of local minimum wage increases on a key
  low-wage retail sector, and using data on labor market concentration that covers
  the entirety of the United States with fine spatial variation at the occupation
  level. The results carry over to the fast-food sector and the entire low-wage labor
  market, and are robust to using proxies of labor market concentration available
  for a broader range of industries, such as the number of establishments and population
  density. A model of oligosponistic competition can explain these effects: there
  is more room to increase wages in high concentration areas where wages tend to be
  further below marginal productivity. These findings provide evidence supporting
  monopsonistic wage setting as an explanation for the near-zero minimum wage employment
  effect documented in prior work.'
