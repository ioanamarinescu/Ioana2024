abstract: 'How does unemployment insurance (UI) affect unemployed workers’ search
  behavior? Search models predict that until benefit exhaustion, UI depresses job
  search effort and increases reservation wages. Over an unemployment spell, search
  effort should increase up to benefit exhaustion and stay high thereafter. Meanwhile,
  reservation wages should decrease up to benefit exhaustion and stay low thereafter.
  To test these predictions, we link administrative registers to data on job search
  behavior from a major online job search platform in France. We follow over 400,000
  workers, as long as they remain unemployed. We analyze the changes in search behavior
  around benefits exhaustion and take two steps to isolate the individual response
  to unemployment benefits. First, our longitudinal data allows us to correct for
  changes in sample composition over the spell. Second, we exploit data on workers
  eligible for 12–24 months of UI as well as workers ineligible for UI, to control
  for behavior changes over the unemployment spell that are independent of UI. Our
  results confirm the predictions of search models. We find that search effort (the
  number of job applications) increases by at least 50% during the year preceding
  benefits exhaustion and remains high thereafter. The target monthly wage decreases
  by at least 2.4% during the year preceding benefits exhaustion and remains low thereafter.
  In addition, we provide evidence for duration dependence: workers decrease the wage
  they target by 1.5% over each year of unemployment, irrespective of their UI status.'
