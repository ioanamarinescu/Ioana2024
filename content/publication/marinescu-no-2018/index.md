abstract: 'The universal basic income has become a widely discussed measure in policy
  circles around the world. In this review, we cover the evidence relevant to its
  potential impact in the US, and in developed countries more generally. Many studies
  find no statistically significant effect of an unconditional cash transfer on the
  probability of working. In the studies that do find an effect on labor supply, the
  effect is small: a 10% income increase induced by an unconditional cash transfer
  decreases labor supply by about 1%. The evidence shows that an unconditional cash
  transfer can improve health and educational outcomes, and decrease criminality and
  drug & alcohol use, especially among the most disadvantaged youths.'
