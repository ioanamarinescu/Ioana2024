abstract: By reducing the commitment made by employers, fixed-term contracts can help
  low-skilled youth find a first job. However, the long-term impact of fixed-term
  contracts on these workers’ careers may be negative. Using Spanish social security
  data, we analysed the impact of a large liberalisation in the regulation of fixed-term
  contracts in 1984. Using a cohort regression discontinuity design, we find that
  over the first 10 years in the labour market, the reform reduced the number of days
  worked (by 4.9%) and earnings (by 9.8%). Over 27 years of labour market career,
  yearly earnings losses amount to a persistent 7.3%.
