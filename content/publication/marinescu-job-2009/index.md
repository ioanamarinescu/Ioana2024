abstract: Even in countries with high average job security, workers with low tenure
  typically enjoy very limited job protection. This study analyzes the impact of such
  a feature on job duration. It uses a 1999 British reform that increased job security
  for workers with 1–2 years of tenure. The firing hazard for these workers decreased
  by 26% relative to the hazard for workers with 2–4 years of tenure. The firing hazard
  for workers with 0–1 year of tenure also decreased by 19%, which is consistent with
  better recruitment practices and hence improved match quality.
