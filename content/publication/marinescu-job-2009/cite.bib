 abstract = {Even in countries with high average job security, workers with low tenure typically enjoy very limited job protection. This study analyzes the impact of such a feature on job duration. It uses a 1999 British reform that increased job security for workers with 1–2 years of tenure. The firing hazard for these workers decreased by 26% relative to the hazard for workers with 2–4 years of tenure. The firing hazard for workers with 0–1 year of tenure also decreased by 19%, which is consistent with better recruitment practices and hence improved match quality.},
