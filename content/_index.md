        **Exciting Funding Opportunity for Early-Career Researchers!**  
      
        Artificial Intelligence (**#AI**) keeps me up at night. What will happen to work and workers?  

        I'm thrilled to announce a collaboration with **Schmidt Sciences** to offer up to **$200,000 in funding** for early-career researchers. This initiative aims to explore AI's impact on **job search and matching, labor market competition, and job quality**.  

        I will help selected applicants after the initial stage to develop their proposals to **maximize the chances they get funded**. I really look forward to mentoring the next generation!  

        **Application Deadline: March 31, 2025.**  

        Don't miss this chance to make a significant impact in the field.
